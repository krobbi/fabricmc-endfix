# Endfix
__v1.1.4__ for Minecraft Fabric __1.16.x__  
A Minecraft Fabric mod to fix a bug where End spikes (pillars) and gateways
would generate asymmetrically since version 1.14. Endfix also makes End portals
visible from below when installed on the client.  
i.e: A fix for [MC-151399](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-151399) and
[MC-3366](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-3366).

The mod can be downloaded from the
[releases page](https://github.com/krobbi/fabricmc-endfix/releases).

v1.1.4 is confirmed working in ```Minecraft 1.16.5```
with ```Fabric Loader 0.11.2-1.16.5```
and ```Fabric API 0.31.0+1.16```.

__Endfix will only have an effect when End spikes and gateways are generated. It
won't fix existing end gateways, but it will move End spikes that are
regenerated by respawning the ender dragon. Note that if the End spikes move,
misplaced obsidian will be left behind.__

It is recommended to keep Endfix installed as the positions of the End spikes
are cached. This cache is not saved to disk and is lost when the server (or
singleplayer internal server) restarts, or if the world seed changes.

NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG.
